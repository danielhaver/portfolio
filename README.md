Project descriptions:

<b>hyperparams</b> - Contribution to a project to build and optimize a sentence complexity classification model based on 400K sentences.  Area of focus was on establishing baseline results, optimizing hyperparameters (via GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV), and understanding results for Decision Tree and Random Forest models.  

<b>nltk_reveiws</b> - Examined +9M user product reviews to analyze, visualize, and extract textual descriptors for top rated items using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib along with NLTK libraries for parts of speech tagging.

<b>open_api</b> - Medium article that shows how to use DALL-E APIs in Python to return a personalized AI generated image.
